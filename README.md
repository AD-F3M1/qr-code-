## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

This are the new tag and css properties i learnt while working on this project.

```html
    <link
      rel="icon"
      type="image/png"
      sizes="32x32"
      href="./images/favicon-32x32.png"
    />
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  box-shadow: 0 6px 17px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.07);box-shadow: 0 6px 17px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.07);
  min-width: 300px;
  min-height: 500px;
  max-width: 340px;
  flex-direction: column;
  position: relative;
}
```


### Continued development

I would like to continue developing responsive designs so my projects can be accessed from any screen.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me with the box shadow property i was searching for it so i saw it in this website its a very good website for frontend beginners.
